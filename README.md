to create a divergent conflict
## step 1: I run git config --system --unset pull.rebase
## step 2: I made a develop branch and pushed a file into it and pushed develop on github
## step 3: I cut a branch from develop and cut another branch from new branch 
## step 4: I updated the file and pushed to new branch and merged the branch with develop 
## step 5: I updated the file in another branch ands saved the commits
## step 6: I pulled the develop branch in the second branch then a divergent issue aroused
## step 7: I resolved that issue and merge the code successfully
